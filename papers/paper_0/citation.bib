Data from different species is automatically mapped to a common pathway space. Public data from ExpressionAtlas and Single Cell ExpressionAtlas can be directly integrated in the analysis. ReactomeGSA greatly reduces the technical barrier for multi-omics, cross-species, comparative pathway analyses.We used ReactomeGSA to characterize the role of B cells in anti-tumor immunity. We compared B cell rich and poor human cancer samples from five of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) transcriptomics and two of the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) proteomics studies. B cell-rich lung adenocarcinoma samples lacked the otherwise present activation through NFkappaB. This may be linked to the presence of a specific subset of tumor associated IgG+ plasma cells that lack NFkappaB activation in scRNA-seq data from human melanoma.

The Neo4j graph database and its query language, Cypher, provide efficient access to the complex Reactome data model, facilitating easy traversal and knowledge discovery. The adoption of this technology greatly improved query efficiency, reducing the average query time by 93%. The web service built on top of the graph database provides programmatic access to Reactome data by object oriented queries, but also supports more complex queries that take advantage of the new underlying graph-based data storage.

In this chapter, we describe the detailed procedures on how this functional interaction network is constructed by integrating multiple external data sources, extracting functional interactions from human curated pathway databases, building a machine learning classifier called a Na{\"i}ve Bayesian Classifier, predicting interactions based on the trained Na{\"i}ve Bayesian Classifier, and finally constructing the functional interaction database. We also provide an example on how to use ReactomeFIViz for performing network-based data analysis for a list of genes.",

Incidence data (through 2018) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2019) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2022, 1,918,030 new cancer cases and 609,360 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States, including approximately 350 deaths per day from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death. Incidence during 2014 through 2018 continued a slow increase for female breast cancer (by 0.5\% annually) and remained stable for prostate cancer, despite a 4\% to 6\% annual increase for advanced disease since 2011. Consequently, the proportion of prostate cancer diagnosed at a distant stage increased from 3.9\% to 8.2\% over the past decade. In contrast, lung cancer incidence continued to decline steeply for advanced disease while rates for localized-stage increased suddenly by 4.5\% annually, contributing to gains both in the proportion of localized-stage diagnoses (from 17\% in 2004 to 28\% in 2018) and 3-year relative survival (from 21\% to 31\%). Mortality patterns reflect incidence trends, with declines accelerating for lung cancer, slowing for breast cancer, and stabilizing for prostate cancer. In summary, progress has stagnated for breast and prostate cancers but strengthened for lung cancer, coinciding with changes in medical practice related to cancer screening and/or treatment. More targeted cancer control interventions and investment in improved early detection and treatment would facilitate reductions in cancer mortality.},

In this way, therapeutics can be centered toward patients based on their molecular presentation rather than grouping them into broad categories with a "one size fits all" approach.

Using the data matrix, we are able to catalog the links between proteins in chemical space as a polypharmacology interaction network. We demonstrate that probabilistic models can be used to predict pharmacology from a large knowledge base. The relationships between proteins, chemical structures and drug-like properties provide a framework for developing a probabilistic approach to drug discovery that can be exploited to increase research productivity.},

However,identification of selective compounds en masse to create targeted screening sets is non-trivial. A systematic approach is needed to prioritize probes, which prevents the repeated use of published but unselective compounds. Here we performed a meta-analysis of integrated large-scale, heterogeneous bioactivity data to create an evidence-based, quantitative metric to systematically rank tool compounds for targets. Our tool score (TS) was then tested on hundreds of compounds by assessing their activity profiles in a panel of 41 cell-based pathway assays. We demonstrate that high-TS tools show more reliably selective phenotypic profiles than lower-TS compounds. Additionally we highlight frequently tested compounds that are non-selective tools and distinguish target family polypharmacology from cross-family promiscuity. TS can therefore be used to prioritize compounds from heterogeneous databases for phenotypic screening.},
